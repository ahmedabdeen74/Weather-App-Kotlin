# Weather Forecast Application üå¶Ô∏è

An Android mobile application that provides real-time weather updates based on your location or a selected location. The app allows users to view weather details, set weather alerts, manage favorite locations, and customize settings like temperature units, wind speed units, and language.

## üìã Project Overview

The **Weather Forecast Application** is designed to deliver accurate weather information using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api). It supports features like:

- Displaying current weather status and temperature for your location.
- Allowing users to pick a specific location via a map or search using auto-complete.
- Adding locations to a favorites list to quickly access their weather information.
- Setting weather alerts for conditions like rain, wind, extreme temperatures, fog, snow, etc.
- Customizing settings such as temperature units (Celsius, Kelvin, Fahrenheit), wind speed units (meter/sec, miles/hour), and language (Arabic, English).
